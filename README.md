Conscious Closet is an application which helps consumers add transparency and accountability to the cycle of their clothing consumption habits. This is accomplished by approximating environmental impacts both before they purchase (water use) and after they discard clothing items (waste contribution). When a clothing item is added to their closet, the Conscious Closet approximates the water usage it took to create the item based on user given information about it and adds it to the user’s Total Water Usage. When a clothing item is deleted from their closet, the user has 3 options: Throw Away, Donate, or Reuse. Throwing the item away contributes 100% of the clothing item’s waste potential (based on user given type information) to the user’s Total Waste Contribution. Donation of the item contributes 84% (based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s data). Reuse of the item contributes 0%. 

This is a mobile first application with dark-mode only.
